        <p>Speedcubing (also known as speedsolving, or just cubing) is a sport involving solving a variety of combination puzzles, the most famous being the 3x3x3 puzzle or Rubik's Cube, as quickly as possible. For most puzzles, solving entails performing a series of moves that alters a scrambled puzzle into a state in which every face of the puzzle is a single, solid color. Some puzzles have different requirements to be considered solved, such as the Clock, for which all the dials must be moved into the 12 'o clock position.[1] The standard puzzle sizes are 2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 6x6x6, and 7x7x7 and the different variations, 3x3x3 one handed, 3x3x3 blindfolded, 4x4x4 blindfolded and 5x5x5 blindfolded. There are also different shapes of the famous puzzles, including Pyraminx, Megaminx, Skewb and Square-1. An individual who competes in speedcubing is known as a speedcuber

        <p>Zemdegs bought his first speedcube in April 2008 after being inspired by speedcubing videos and tutorials on YouTube.[5] The first unofficial time he recorded was an average of 19.73 seconds on 14 June 2008.[6] He has been using CFOP to solve the 3×3×3 since he was 12 years old, the Yau method to solve the 4×4×4, the CLL method to solve the 2×2×2, and the Reduction method for 5×5×5 through 7×7×7.[citation needed] He has won 609 events, he has come second in 109 events and he has come third in 59 events in total across many Rubik's cube competitions.[7]
